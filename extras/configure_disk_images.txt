First, generate a VirtualBox VDI image for the kernel to live in.

Either run build_support/create_disk_image.sh AS ROOT, and use output/azalea_disk_image.vdi
Or use the provided example disk image extras/example_disk_image.vdi.

The first method requires extra tooling to be installed, but is obviously customisable. Either way will suffice though.
Copy the disk image of choice to the project root directory as kernel_disc_image.vdi.

Configure a mounting point for the disk image - the code assumes ~/disk_mount - as follows:

- Add the following to fstab:
/dev/nbd0p1 {full path of ~/disk_mount} vfat noauto,users,rw 0 0
- Before compiling for the first time each day execute:
 - sudo modprobe nbd
 - qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 ./kernel_disc_image.vdi
 - mount ~/disk_mount

Of course, any other method that causes the first partition of the virtual disk to be mounted in the place the build
script will write to is probably acceptable.

Don't forget to test thoroughly!
