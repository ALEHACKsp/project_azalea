1: Copy kernel_disc_image_example.vdi to kernel_disc_image.vdi AND kernel_disc_image_nonlive.vdi.

2: In fstab, add:
{path}/kernel_disc_image.vdi {directory to mount in - ~/disk_mount ideally} vfat loop,noauto,users,rw,offset=40448 0 0

 - Note that if you don't use ~/disk_mount, it is necessary to alter build_support/copy_image.sh to match.

3: Test.
