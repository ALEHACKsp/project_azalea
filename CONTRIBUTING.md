# Guidelines for contributions.

Firstly, thank you for offering to contribute! I'm very flattered. A couple of things to bear in mind.

- Since this is a hobby project, there might be some elements I'd prefer to implement myself - for the fun of it.
  Please don't be offended if you find one of those.
  
- Having said that, bug fixes are _always_ welcome. :simple_smile:
  
- There are some loose [coding standards](./extras/Coding Standards.txt) that I'd prefer to try and stick to. I've not
  always done a terribly good job I realise, so I'll try not to be too pedantic.
