#Project Azalea - Welcome

Project Azalea is an attempt to create a complete, but basic, OS kernel and enough tools that a user can interact with
it. It's not big or fancy, it was started as a plaything for the author but he thought it might be interesting or
useful for anyone else trying the same thing.

Project Azalea isn't the name of the finished product - it is merely a codename. Whether or not the project matures
enough to warrant a proper name remains to be seen.

## More information

Further information about the project can be found in [Introduction.md](./docs/Introduction.md)

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome, but might respectfully be declined - being a hobby system there are some things Martin
would prefer to keep to himself. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for further details.

Even if you don't want to contribute but would be interested in a conversation about the project (or most other
things!) then please do get in touch.
